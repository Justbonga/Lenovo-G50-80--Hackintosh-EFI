# Lenovo G50-80 Hackintosh

## For hacintosh beginners:

This repo allows you to have a bootable Lenovo G50-80 Hackinosh running Mac OS 10.15 beta

### Bugs:

1. When the device is sleeping it can cause it to reboot

2. Sometimes when other devices are connected via usb they can cause it reboot

3. Since I used VoodooHDA for the audio:
    1. The sound doesn't automatically switch between the aux port and internal speakers.
    2. The sound quality isn't that good you are audiophile
    3. The sound loudness level is reduced than if it were to be running windows
    4. There is a weird screeching sound when songs or videos or changing or they are  silent for a second 

4. Bluetooth:
    1. Bluetooth can't be switched off
    2. Bluetooth can't do file transfers with other devices
    3. Bluetooth when will disconnect from bluetooth devices when no audio, video or sound is playing

5. Trackpad cant be used and aren't available in the settings
6.
