# Lenovo G50-80 Hackintosh

## For hacintosh beginners:

This repo allows you to have a bootable Lenovo G50-80 Hackinosh running Mac OS 10.15 beta

### Bugs:

1. When the device is sleeping it can cause it to reboot

2. Sometimes when other devices are connected via usb they can cause it reboot

3. Since I used VoodooHDA for the audio:
    1. The sound doesn't automatically switch between the aux port and internal speakers.

    2. The sound quality isn't that good you are audiophile
   
    3. The sound loudness level is reduced
